            <p>
            <img src="static/me.jpg"  height="300" align="right" hspace="50" vspace="10"> I was born and raised in Santa Barbara, CA, where I spent my formative years enjoying the ocean, the mountains, and the perpetually perfect weather. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After graduating from <a href="http://www.dphs.org/">Dos Pueblos High School</a>, I proceeded to major in <a href="http://physics.berkeley.edu/">Physics at U.C. Berkeley</a>, where I was introduced to the wonders of astrophysics, and to my brilliant wife, <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/faculty_bios/view/Shabnam_Javdani">Shabnam Javdani</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Next, we moved to Urbana, IL, where I earned my Ph.D. in physics at <a href="http://physics.illinois.edu/">UIUC</a>, working with <a href="http://physics.illinois.edu/people/profile.asp?slshapir">Stuart Shapiro</a> on fully relativistic computer simulations accreting, merging binary black holes. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I am currently a theoretical astrophysicist, working as a postdoctoral researcher with <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~zoltan/">Zoltan Haiman</a> in the <a href="http://www.astro.columbia.edu/">astronomy department at Columbia University</a> and <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/aim/">Andrew MacFadyen</a> at the <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/">Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at New York University</a>. My research focuses on electromagnetic signatures of accreting supermassive binary black holes.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the past several years, I have been amazed to see how quickly things are changing in both astrophysics and industry as a result of the techniques of data science seeing increased use. I find this to be extremely exciting and I am looking forward to transitioning further into this domain in the near future.

            <h4>Supernovae</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="researchitem">A supernova is the violent, explosive death of a star.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">Such an explosion is so luminous that it can outshine the galaxy which hosts it.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">Supernovae can be split into many subclasses, depending on the observational properties, which are in turn linked to the properties of the projenitor star.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">One subclass is called Type 1A Supernovae. These are believed to be caused by explosions of white dwarfs.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">Type 1A Supernovae are of particular interest because they can be used as "standard candles", which allow us to make simultaneous measurements of distance and redshift. These measurements are what led to the discovery that the universe is accelerating in it's expansion, presumably due to a "dark energy" which fills the universe.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">In my research, supervised by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Perlmutter">Saul Perlmutter</a> in the <a href="http://supernova.lbl.gov/">Supernova Cosmology Project</a> at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, I worked on the discovery pipeline for the supernovae, which involves filtering through huge numbers of subtracted images of the sky, combing the data for changes in brightness over time which mark the presence of a supernova.
                <li class="researchitem">I also worked on the processing of lightcurves, or plots of brightness vs. time in different frequency bands, for archived supernovae.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Binary Black Holes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="researchitem">It is currently believed that most, if not all galaxies have extremely massive (between a million and a billion times the mass of the sun) black holes at their centers. These are referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole">Supermassive Black Holes</a>.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">Galaxies are also known to merge with each other, combining to form a new galaxy which contains two very massive black holes.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">Once these black holes get close enough to begin orbiting one another, we refer to this as a "Supermassive Binary Black Hole" system.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">These binaries are so massive that they can create ripples in spacetime called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">gravitational waves</a> which can travel all the way to earth and (hopefully) be measured. People are currently working very hard on extremely ambitious experiments such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">LIGO</a> in order to detect these gravitational waves.
                <li class="researchitem">Gas that is nearby one of these binaries will form a disk. This disk can become very hot and bright, and we can hope to observe them with our telescopes.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">In my research, I use supercomputers to perform simulations of these systems in order to make predictions about observational signatures we can exploit to help us discover them.</li>
                <li class="researchitem">The simulations I am currently working on are performed on large supercomputers such as NASA's <a href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/resources/pleiades.html">Pleiades Supercomputer</a> using a code called <a href="http://duffell.org/disco.html">DISCO</a>, which was originally created by <a href="http://duffell.org/">Paul Duffell</a> at NYU.

            <h2 id="DataScience">Data Science</h2>
            <p>Living in New York City, I am fortunate to be surrounded by an extremely vibrant data science community, which I found myself getting drawn into when I moved here in 2012. In addition to seeing the growing influence of Big Data techniques in the astrophysics departments at Columbia and NYU, I was able to take advantage of the community of data scientists outside academia in the city by attending meetups. I decided in 2015 to leave astrophysics and I was accepted as a fellow at the Data Incubator. Following the fellowship, I had the opportunity to join Capital One Labs, where I have been working since.</p> 

<!--            <p>Additionally, last spring I was able to take part in a reading group at Columbia for the book, <a href="http://amzn.com/0691151687">Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy: A Practical Python Guide for the Analysis of Survey Data</a>, which I highly recommend for any other astrophysicists who are interested in learning more about data science. It is a very clear and well organized book which is extremely Python-centric and emphasizes practical examples.

            <p>I have also learned a lot from courses I have taken at <a href="https://www.coursera.orgi">Coursera</a>. In particular, I highly recommend their <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage">Data Science Specialization series of courses</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Stanford Machine Learning course</a> and the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/db">Stanford Introduction to Databases</a>. You can see a list of all of the Coursera courses I have taken on my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/i/483499292161b681833a2eaa16cf2780">profile page</a>.</p>
            <h3>Fun Data Projects</h3>
            <h4><a href="static/citibike.html">Exploring Citibike Data</a></h4>
            Citibike is a bike sharing program in New York City. Each time a bike is checked out of a kiosk and returned, data about the trip and the user is recorded and made public. This is a massive dataset that I thought would be fun to play around with a bit and see what pops out.
            <h4><a href="static/digit_recognizer.html">Handwritten Digit Classification</a></h4> 
            Inspired by the list of practice competitions on <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/>Kaggle">Kaggle</a>, I decided to use the MNIST database of handwritten digits as an opportunity to play around with a few different machine learning classification algorithms. It's a great dataset to play around with because it's so well studied and it is possible to compare a lot of different algorithms relatively easily and get rather impressive results. See link above for details.
            <h4><a href="static/weight_lifting.html">Exercise Classification Based on Accelerometer Data</a></h4>
            I originally worked on this study for a course project in the Coursera practical machine learning course. I was required to perform the analysis in R for the course. I have nothing against R at all, but I prefer to do everything in Python these days. I had a lot of fun with this dataset, so I thought it would be worthwhile to redo it in Python using pandas to handle the data cleaning and scikit-learn for the random forest implementation. 
-->
<p>In addition to practicing Data Science and Machine Learning, I also enjoy the challenge of communicating these topics. Below are two talks that I recently gave on Reinforcement Learning, a topic which I have been particularly fascinated by lately.</p>

<p>A talk on "Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Armed Bandits" which I gave for the "Data Science in 30 Minutes" series at the Data Incubator.</p>

<h4><a href="http://superbowl.brianfarris.me/">Mining Social Media Data for Insights into Viewer Attention and Engagement During Large-Scale Media Events</a></h4>
            I have used the Twitter Streaming API to download 1.5 million tweets containing the word "superbowl" during the 2015 game. I then played around with the data a bit to see what I could find.

                As a hobby, I have been teaching myself how to write <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> web apps using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, and deploying them on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. Here are a couple of examples:
                <h4><a href = "http://flog.brianfarris.me/" color="red">FLOG</a>: brian <font color="red">F</font>arris's <font color="red">LOG</font>ging app.</h4>
                A nice app for keeping lists, journals, and logging activities. It uses <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/features/sign-in">Google+ Sign-in</a> for authentication. Eventually, I would like to add analysis to monitor progress, etc. For now the only thing it does is make goofy word clouds from text entries.

            <h4>Music</h4>
            <p>
            While I theoretically enjoy playing guitar as a hobby, that doesn't actually happen very often. I generally find that I prefer to spend time tinkering with music-related equiptment.

                <h4>Brewing</h4>
                <p>
                Like most geeks, I went through a beer brewing phase a few years ago. It was fun, but I quickly realized that I was too lazy to keep it up, so I now stick to brewing <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f25/man-i-love-apfelwein-14860/">apfelwein</a>. It tastes delicious, and it can be made with even less effort than going to the store to buy alcohol. Here is a picture of my latest batch:

                <p>
                Living in the city, I don't get out into nature as often as I would like. However, we do the best we can. Here are some pics from various adventures over the years:
