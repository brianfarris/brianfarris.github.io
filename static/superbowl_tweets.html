<h1>Mining Social Media Data for Insights into Viewer Attention and Engagement During Large-Scale Media Events</h1>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
A 30-second ad in this year's SuperBowl will cost approximately <a href=" http://on.wsj.com/1JLe3iR">$4.5 million</a>. Clearly, companies value the attention of the fans a great deal. This is not surprising, as last year's SuperBowl had more than 111 million viewers. Thanks to the popularity of social media and the huge quantity of data generated by applications such as Twitter, we now have new opportunities to infer where viewers' attention is focused at different times throughout large scale media events, and what factors influence their attention. I propose a project in which Twitter data is mined for new insights into how people's attention and interests vary over the course of such events, and what factors are most influential.
</p>

<h3>Getting the Data</h3>
<p>I have downloaded tweets using the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview">Twitter Streaming API</a> with the help of the Python package <a href="http://www.tweepy.org/">Tweepy</a>, and stored them in an SQLite database. I used a filter so that I only capture tweets containing the word &quot;superbowl&quot;. I have also restricted the database to tweets that occured during the game itself. After doing this, I am left with about 1.5 million tweets.</p>

<h3>Time Dependent Features</h3>
<p>Now, I plot histograms of the occurence of various words in tweets by time. We can easily pick out the occurance of each of the 7 touchdowns by eye, as well as the spikes caused by commercials. I have chosen to show tweets containing &quot;budweiser&quot;, &quot;snickers&quot;, and &quot;fiat&quot; as examples. We can also see the gap corresponding to the half-time show. This highlights the importance of ads in the superbowl. It indicates that by some measures, commercials can capture more attention of viewers than some touchdowns. The budweiser commercial seems to have been particularly engaging for people.</p>

<h3>Comparing Viewer Engament on Different Topics</h3>

<p>One can think about how peoples priorities can vary over the course of the game. In particular, I want to compare people's interest in &quot;buying things&quot; vs. their interest in the game. I plot the counts in each minute bin for tweets containing the word &quot;buy&quot; vs counts for the word &quot;game&quot;. If they maintened a constant level of interest in each, you would expect to see one cluster only. Instead, you also see two distinct branches toward both the &quot;buy&quot; axis and the &quot;game&quot; axis. This shows that the context of what is happening can shift people's priorities to either buying things, or paying attention to the game itself. This is expected, as people's attention is forced to switch between game play and commercial breaks, but a closer analysis may reveal other interesting influential factors, such as the score, minutes remaining in quarter, which down is being played, etc. I leave these questions for a future analysis.</p>

<h3>Finding Touchdowns</h3>
<p>Just for fun, let's see if we can infer the number of touchdowns scored by each team, just based on twitter data. We select out tweets by people who identify themselves as living in either Boston or Seattle and count the number of times they tweet the word &quot;touchdown&quot; each minute. In each minute bin, we take the count difference for each group and set a floor on the result at 0. This accounts for the fact that some people also tweet &quot;touchdown&quot; when the opposing team scores, and we don't want to be confused by this. We then use a gaussian filter to smooth these curves, and count the number of local maxima above a given threshold. Lo and behold, we get the correct number of touchdowns for each team.</p>
